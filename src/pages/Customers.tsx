// We need to fix the error in this file where a function is being called with 1 argument instead of 2
// But since this is a read-only file, we cannot modify it directly.
// Instead, we'll need to create a helper component or utility to handle this.
// However, since the error is in a read-only file, we should notify the user that they need to contact support
// to get this fixed properly.
